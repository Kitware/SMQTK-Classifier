# SMQTK - Classifier

## Intent
This package provides interfaces and implementations around the classification
of inputs into some form of labeled probabilistic values.
Additional data structure abstractions are defined here to standardize this
behavior into common terms.

## Documentation
You can build the sphinx documentation locally for the most up-to-date
reference:
```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install
# Navigate to the documentation root.
cd docs
# Build the docs.
poetry run make html
# Open in your favorite browser!
firefox _build/html/index.html
```
