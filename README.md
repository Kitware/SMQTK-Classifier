# SMQTK
![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Kitware/SMQTK.svg?branch=master)

Social Multimedia Query ToolKit aims to provide a simple and easy to use interface for content descriptor generation for machine learning, content similarity computation (kNN implementations), and relevancy ranking for online Iterative Query Refinement (IQR) adjudications.


## Intent
SMQTK is intended to be a python toolkit that allows users to, as easily as possibly, apply various machine learning algorithms and techniques to different types of data for different high level applications.
Examples of high level applications may include wanting to search a media corpus for similar content, or providing a relevancy feedback interface for a web application.
