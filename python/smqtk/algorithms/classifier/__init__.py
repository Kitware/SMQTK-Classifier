    Discover and return discovered ``Classifier`` classes. Keys in the returned
    map are the names of the discovered classes, and the paired values are the
    actual class type objects.

    We search for implementation classes in:
        - modules next to this file this function is defined in (ones that begin
          with an alphanumeric character),
        - python modules listed in the environment variable ``CLASSIFIER_PATH``
            - This variable should contain a sequence of python module
              specifications, separated by the platform specific PATH separator
              character (``;`` for Windows, ``:`` for unix)

    Within a module we first look for a helper variable by the name
    ``CLASSIFIER_CLASS``, which can either be a single class object or an
    iterable of class objects, to be specifically exported. If the variable is
    set to None, we skip that module and do not import anything. If the variable
    is not present, we look at attributes defined in that module for classes
    that descend from the given base class type. If none of the above are found,
    or if an exception occurs, the module is skipped.

    :param reload_modules: Explicitly reload discovered modules from source.
    :type reload_modules: bool

    :return: Map of discovered class object of type ``Classifier``
        whose keys are the string names of the classes.
