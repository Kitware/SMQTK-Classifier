* Updated tested Python versions to ``3.10â€“3.13``.

Algorithms

CI

  for the existing libsvm-based plugin.

Fixes
-----

CI

* Modified CI unittests workflow to run for PRs targetting branches that match
  the `release*` glob.

* Codecov integration to support coverage reporting on pull requests from forks (unprotected branches).

Dependency Versions

* Updated the developer dependency and locked version of ipython to address a
  security vulnerability.

* Removed `jedi = "^0.17"` requirement and updated to `ipython = "^7.17.3"`
  since recent ipython update appropriately addresses the dependency.
