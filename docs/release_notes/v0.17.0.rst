v0.17.0
=======
This minor release introduces the pending deprecation of the ``Classifier`` and
the ``SupervisedClassifier`` interface names, subsequently renamed to
``ClassifyDescriptor`` and ``ClassifyDescriptorSupervised``, respectively.
We also introduce a new, image-specific interface pair: ``ClassifyImage`` and
``ClassifyImageSupervised``.
These interfaces follow closely to the API of the original descriptor-based
interfaces but instead take in image matrices as the primary input to be
described.


Updates / New Features
----------------------

Interfaces

* Classifier and SupervisedClassifier split into ClassifyImage,
  ClassifyImageSupervised, ClassifyDescriptor, and ClassifyDescriptorSupervised

* Rather than just taking in Descriptors, the SMQTK-Classifier can work
  directly with both Descriptors and Images

* Standardized Image input to follow the format of numpy matrices
